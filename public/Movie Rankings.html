<h1>Some Movies Okayest Movies I've Seen</h1>

<h2>Recently <br /> 2022-2024</h2>

<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<h4>*****</h4>
<p>This is the most recent movie I've seen in cinemas, and, therefore, the best. Nothing beats it, unless we'll go to watch another good movie in cinemas soon-ish.</p>

<h3>Dune 1</h3>
<h4>*****</h4>
<p>Seen this on Netflix and its a solid prequel, even when watched on a shitty TV like ours.</p>

<h3>Palm Springs</h3>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>Surprisingly amazing time-loop film that got me really invested in the story, or something. Funny, cute, pretty decent.</p>

<h3>Glass Onion</h3>
<h4>**</h4>
<p>Kind of annoying and pretentios, but has Daniel Craig with a cool accent as well as wonderful visuals. I wish this thing had autocorrect.</p>
